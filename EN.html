Moving Landscape

Hilde Domin 

Translated by Mich√®le Mendelssohn


One has to be able to leave

yet still remain like a tree

as if we were rooted to the ground

as if things moved past us, yet we stood still.

One has to hold one's breath

until the wind dies down

and the unfamiliar air encircles us,

until the play of light and shadow,

of green and blue,

reveals familiar patterns

and we are at home

wherever that may be

And we may sit down and rest

as if leaning on our mother's grave.
